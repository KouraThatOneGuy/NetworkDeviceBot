# NetworkDeviceBot

## Overview
**NetworkDeviceBot** is a PowerShell-based automation tool designed to scan, access, and interact with devices on a local network. It provides functionalities such as:
- Device discovery and connectivity checking
- Network scanning
- Remote access via PowerShell, SSH, SNMP, and WMI
- Port scanning
- Shared folder access
- Credential management for authenticated operations

This bot is intended for **educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use on networks without permission may violate cybersecurity laws.
