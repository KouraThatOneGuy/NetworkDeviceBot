# NetworkDeviceBot

## Overview
**NetworkDeviceBot** is a PowerShell-based automation tool designed to scan, access, and interact with devices on a local network. It provides functionalities such as:
- Device discovery and connectivity checking
- Network scanning
- Remote access via PowerShell, SSH, SNMP, and WMI
- Port scanning
- Shared folder access
- Credential management for authenticated operations
- Automated backup management
- Logging system for network events
- Machine learning model integration for network analysis
- Web dashboard for real-time monitoring
- Task scheduling for automated operations

This bot is intended for **educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use on networks without permission may violate cybersecurity laws.

### **Prerequisites**
- Windows with PowerShell 5.1 or later.
- Administrator privileges for certain operations (e.g., WMI queries, remote PowerShell execution).
- OpenSSH installed for SSH functionality.
- **Python environment for ML model execution (if using anomaly detection).**

## Features & Commands
### **Device Connectivity Check**
```powershell
$bot.CheckDeviceConnectivity("192.168.1.10")
```
Checks if a device is reachable via ICMP ping and verifies if TCP port 80 is open.

### **Network Scanning**
```powershell
$devices = $bot.ScanNetwork()
```
Scans the subnet for active devices.

### **Remote Command Execution**
```powershell
$bot.ExecuteRemoteCommand("192.168.1.10", { Get-Process })
```
Runs PowerShell commands on a remote machine using WinRM.

### **Port Scanning**
```powershell
$openPorts = $bot.ScanPorts("192.168.1.10")
```
Scans for open ports on a target device.

### **Accessing Shared Folders**
```powershell
$bot.AccessSharedFolder("192.168.1.10", "SharedFolder")
```
Maps a network share as a local drive.

### **SNMP & WMI Information Retrieval**
```powershell
$snmpInfo = $bot.GetSNMPInfo("192.168.1.10")
$wmiInfo = $bot.GetWMIInfo("192.168.1.10")
```
Fetches system information using SNMP or WMI queries.

### **Automated Backups**
```powershell
$bot.CreateBackup("C:\BackupLocation")
```
Stores a backup of critical network data in the configured backup directory.

### **Logging System**
```powershell
$bot.LogEvent("Network scan completed successfully.")
```
Saves network events and errors to log files in `C:\NetworkDeviceBot\Logs`.

### **Machine Learning Anomaly Detection**
```powershell
$bot.RunMLAnalysis("network_traffic.log")
```
Analyzes network traffic using an integrated ML model stored at `C:\NetworkDeviceBot\MLModel.pkl`.

### **Web Dashboard**
Runs a monitoring dashboard accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### **Task Scheduling**
```powershell
$bot.ScheduleTask("DailyScan", { $bot.ScanNetwork() }, "12:00AM")
```
Schedules recurring network scans or other automated operations.

## Security & Compliance
- **Use on authorized networks only.** Running network scans or remote commands without permission is illegal.
- **Centralized authentication management** ensures secure credential handling.
- **Error handling mechanisms** prevent crashes and unauthorized access.
- **Secure communication protocols** (WinRM, SSH, SNMP) are used where applicable.
- **Automated backups ensure data is protected against loss.**
- **Logging system provides an audit trail of network activities.**

## Disclaimer
**This bot is for educational and ethical network administration purposes only.** Unauthorized scanning, access, or command execution on networks or devices without explicit permission may violate local and international laws. The repository owner is **not responsible for any misuse** of this tool.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-threading for faster scanning.
- Logging and reporting of scan results.
- GUI interface for easier interaction.
- Customizable port scanning range.
- **Enhanced ML-based anomaly detection.**
- **Expanded task automation capabilities.**
